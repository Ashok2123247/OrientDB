Subject: Considerations for Moving to AWS RDS Standard Edition

Hi [Recipient's Name],

If the team is planning to move from the Enterprise edition to AWS RDS Standard edition, here are some key limitations to be aware of:

No Always On Availability Group (AOAG) support

No table or data compression features

In-memory OLTP is not available

No partitioning support for large tables

Online indexing is limited

No resource governor for workload control

Lower scalability in terms of CPU and memory

Limited features for large-scale HA/DR requirements


Questions to consider before moving to Standard edition:

Are we currently using AOAG for high availability or read-scale?

Do any applications rely on compressed or partitioned tables?

Are online index rebuilds required during business hours?

How critical is in-memory performance for any workloads?

Do we have any growth concerns that might exceed Standard limits?


Please let me know if youâ€™d like a deeper feature gap analysis or migration impact assessment.

Best regards,
Ashok


The observed slowdown after the MongoDB restart is primarily due to the database's in-memory cache clearing, requiring a warm-up period.

Before Restart: ~30 GB of data was cached in memory, ensuring fast query responses.

After Restart: The cache started near empty (~0.234 GB), leading to more disk reads and slower initial performance, with increased dirty pages (1GB) and write queue spikes as the system works to catch up.

Performance is expected to improve as the cache repopulates.
