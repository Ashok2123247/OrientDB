**Subject:** MongoDB I/O Issue – Investigation Summary and Recommendations

Dear \[Recipient's Name],

I’ve completed an initial investigation into the recent I/O performance issues observed in our MongoDB environment. Below is a summary of the key findings and recommended actions:

---

**Findings:**

1. **High Data I/O Activity:** We observed a significant increase in data I/O requests compared to typical daily patterns.
2. **Query Routing Behavior:** Many of the expensive queries are initially targeting the **secondary** node before being routed to the **primary**.
3. **Memory Pressure on Secondary:** The secondary node is experiencing memory constraints, with **swap usage reaching 80–90%**, indicating a lack of available RAM.
4. **Connection Stability Issues:** Approximately **50% of client connections** to the secondary node are being interrupted or disconnected, likely due to memory exhaustion.
5. **Recurring Monday Spikes:** Every **Monday**, we’re seeing a consistent spike in data I/O (up to 50% higher). Further investigation is required to identify any scheduled jobs or workloads contributing to this pattern.
6. **Secondary-Preferred Query Load:** A significant number of expensive queries are using **read preference = secondary**, which may be exacerbating the memory and performance issues on the secondary node.

**Recommended Actions:**

* **Query Review & Optimization:** Review the most expensive queries and ensure appropriate **indexing** is in place to reduce I/O and execution time.
* **Query Routing Adjustment:** Adjust query routing preferences to target the **primary node** for high-cost operations, especially under load.
* **Memory Upgrade:** Consider **increasing RAM** on both primary and secondary nodes to reduce swap usage and improve stability.
* **Scheduled Job Audit:** Investigate any **automated jobs scheduled on Mondays** that could be contributing to the I/O spike.
